Medicago truncatula (barrel medic) is a small clover-like annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. Legumes have long been recognized and valued as "soil building" crops. Growing legumes improves soil quality through a process called “nitrogen fixation”, by which nitrogen in the air (useless to all but a few microorganisms) is "fixed" by binding it to other elements, and thus, changing it into a plant available form. For the fixation process to occur, legume plants must enter into a "symbiotic" or mutually beneficial partnership with certain bacteria called rhizobia, which live in nodules on the roots. Perhaps the most famous member of the legume family is alfalfa, a forage legume with complex genetics. The genome of M. truncatula is instead small and diploid, and provides insights and genomic tools to all legumes.
