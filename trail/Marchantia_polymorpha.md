Marchantia polymorpha (umbrella liverwort), is a plant that looks like it came from another planet!! However, liverworts are among the oldest terrestrial plants, with a wide distribution around the world. M. polymorpha is a non-vascular evergreen plant, with separate male and female reproductive structures. 
It is very versatile! It has the ability to tolerate high lead concentrations in soils, along with other heavy metals. And it is also frequently the first vegetation to appear after a large wildfire: after invading the burned area, M. polymorpha grows rapidly, sometimes covering the entire site and helping in the prevention of soil erosion and renewing the humus in the burned soil.  
All of these special characteristics that make M. polymorpha unique are “written” somewhere in its genome, being its study a key to understand the evolution and diversification of land plants, and to address questions related to sex chromosome evolution in plants.

masses to talk about here! Why is it used to elucidate early plant processes, reproduction method, air pores

Marchantia polymorpha is a liverwort from a basal land plant lineage. It is almost cosmopolitan and can be found around human habitats in temperate regions. It is a model plant which has been studied for nearly 200 years. It has a short life cycle, it’s easy to propagate, cross and transform and has a small haploid genome. Its life cycle alternates between multicellular haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte generations. Compared to other land plants exhibits low genetic redundancy.
