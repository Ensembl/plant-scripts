The genomes (“genetic instructions”) of plants shed light on their history, contain evolutionary treasures and are used by breeders. 
Since the publication in 2000 of the model Arabidopsis thaliana genome, the number of genomes has steadily increased. In Ensembl Plants, a public resource of plant genomes, we hold the genomic information of multiple plant species, many of them present in the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens.

Join us on this “Plant DNA trail” to learn which plants genomes have been sequenced to date, what some of these are like, and what geneticists and breeders hope to accomplish through these sequencing efforts.

Did you know that the first documented colours for domesticated carrot root (Daucus carota sp. Sativus) were yellow and purple in Central Asia approximately 1,100 years ago, with orange carrots not reliably reported until the sixteenth century in Europe? Or that there are species like the spikemoss Selaginella lepidophylla (also called “the resurrection plant”) that can be completely dry during years, but that are able to resume normal growth and activity upon rehydration?
There exists a lot of biodiversity within and between plants, and part of it can be understood by exploring their DNA (DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid), which is an essential molecule for life.  In a very real sense, DNA is information. It acts like a recipe holding the instructions for each organism. A genome is an organism’s complete set of DNA.
In Ensembl Plants, a public resource of plant genomes, we hold the genomic information of 61 plant species, many of them present in the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens.

Our trees provide a framework around which the other elements of the Garden have evolved. The current site was originally acquired to accommodate a wide range of trees, and many of the mature specimens seen along the Main Walk and around the perimeter of the western half of the Garden date back to its establishment in 1846. 

All plants in the plant kingdom are grouped into families which share similar characteristics. This is demonstrated in the western half of the Garden, where trees were planted by family as a teaching resource for University students. These family groupings followed the arrangement set out in the early 1800s by Augustin de Candolle, the foremost authority in plant classification of the time.
