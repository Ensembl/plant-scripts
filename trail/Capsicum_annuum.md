Capsicum annuum, one of the oldest domesticated crops in the Americas, is the most widely grown spice crop in the world. It is also a close relative of potato, tomato and tobacco (Solanaceae). Chilli peppers are hot because of a substance called capsaicin which gives them their distinctive hot, peppery taste. This molecule stimulates areas of the skin and tongue that normally sense heat and pain, fooling the brain into thinking they are burning. Capsaicin has been found to repel or poison mammals but not birds. Peppers can be seen in a variety of colors. Chlorophyll, produced in large amounts as the plant grows, is responsible for the unripe, green color. Reduction of this molecule during late growth gives way to carotin and anthocyanin molecules, which gradually produce yellow, red or purple colors. This genome will serve as a platform for improving the nutritional and medicinal values of Capsicum species.
