Selaginella moellendorffii is a spikemoss. They belong to the subdivsion of higher vascular plant called lycophytes, an ancient group of plants appeared around 410 million years ago. Selaginella moellendorffii is the first non-seeded plant genome reported, making it a key species for plant evolution studies.

This spikemossÂ can withstand being completely dried out for years, but is able to resume normal growth and activity by providing it with water. 
It was the first non-seeded plant to have its genome sequenced and is a key species for studying plant evolution.
