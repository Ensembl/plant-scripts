It is a model plant which has been studied for nearly 200 years. It has a short life cycle, itâ€™s easy to propagate, cross and transform and has a small haploid genome. Its life cycle alternates between multicellular haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte generations. Compared to other land plants exhibits low genetic redundancy.
