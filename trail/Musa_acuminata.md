Musa acuminata (Banana), is one of the world’s favourite fruits and vital for food security in many tropical and subtropical countries.  
Even though there is some variability in bananas, today, half of the current production relies on clones (“copies”) of a unique genotype called “Cavendish”. That constitutes a latent problem, because pests and diseases have gradually become adapted, representing an imminent danger for global banana production. Years ago, by 1950, an outbreak of the “Panamá disease”, almost wiped out the commercial Gros Michel banana production, the dominant cultivar in that moment, before Cavendish. And that disease is awaking again…
There is an urgent need of banana improvement. However, bananas are difficult to breed: they are triploid (3 sets of chromosomes) and cannot produce viable seeds. The study of banana´s genome is expected to speed up the improvement process, by identifying genes responsible for fruit quality and pest resistance, saving bananas.

Musa acuminata (banana) is native to tropical South and Southeast Asia and is cultivated throughout the tropics. Grown primarily for its fruit, rich in starch, banana is the most popular fruit in industrialised countries. Cultivars mainly involve Musa acuminata (A-genome) and Musa balbisiana (B-genome) and are sometimes diploid but generally triploid. Banana is the first non-grass monocotyledon to be sequenced, making it an important genome for the comparative analysis of plants.

This is native to tropical South and Southeast Asia and is grown throughout the tropics, primarily for its familiar fruit. Rich in starch, banana is the most popular fruit in industrialised countries. These plants are sometimes diploid (2 sets of chromosomes) but generally triploid 
(3 sets of chromosomes).
