Potato is the world's fourth most important food crop after rice, wheat and maize. The potato genome consists of 12 chromosomes, just like tomato and pepper, in four copies (autotetraploid). As tomato, it was domesticated in the Andes and only introduced elsewhere four centuries ago. Outside of its natural range in South America, the cultivated potato is considered to have a narrow genetic base resulting from limited germplasm introductions to Europe, usually in the form of propagated clonal tissues. Potato cultivars suffer acute inbreeding depression, and are susceptible to many devastating pests and pathogens, as exemplified by the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century. Despite the challenges of tetraploid genomes, genomic tools are already routinely used in institutions such as the International Potato Center in Peru to breed new varieties and to understand the genes that make potatos waxy or fluffy.
