# plant_tools

Here you'll find a few scripts and protocols used during the release cycle of Ensembl Plants.

These are the main steps in the cycle each time a new release is coming up:

* genomes (core dbs) from the previous release are copied from a stage server to a production server

* new genomes/annotations are loaded on a different production server and health-checked
