Musa acuminata (banana), is one of the world’s favourite fruits and vital for food security in many tropical and subtropical countries. Even though there is some variability in bananas, half of the current global production relies on clones (copies) of a unique genotype called “Cavendish”. That constitutes a latent problem, because pests and diseases have gradually become adapted, representing an imminent danger for global production. In 1950 an outbreak of the “Panamá disease” almost wiped out the commercial Gros Michel banana production, the dominant cultivar at the time. As that disease is back there is an urgent need of banana improvement. However, bananas are difficult to breed: they are triploid (3 sets of chromosomes) and cannot produce viable seeds. The study of their genomes is expected to speed up breeding by identifying genes responsible for fruit quality and pest resistance.
