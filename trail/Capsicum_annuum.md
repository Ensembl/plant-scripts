Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum), one of the oldest domesticated crops in the Americas, and is the most widely grown spice crop in the world. It is also a close relative of potato, tomato and tobacco (Solanaceae).

Peppers (or chilies) are hot because of a substance called capsaicin which gives chillies their distinctive hot, peppery taste. The chemical stimulates areas of the skin and tongue that normally sense heat and pain, fooling the brain into thinking they are burning. Capsaicin has been found to repel or poison mammals but not birds.

Hot pepper can be seen in a vareity of colors. This is bacause of the Chlorophyll molecules, which are present in large quantities during the plant's growing process and are responsible for the unripe, green color. Reduction of this molecule later gives way to carotin and anthocyanin molecules, which gradually produce yellow, red or purple colors.
