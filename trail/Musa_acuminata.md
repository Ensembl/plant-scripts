Musa acuminata (banana) is native to tropical South and Southeast Asia and is cultivated throughout the tropics. Grown primarily for its fruit, rich in starch, banana is the most popular fruit in industrialised countries. Cultivars mainly involve Musa acuminata (A-genome) and Musa balbisiana (B-genome) and are sometimes diploid but generally triploid. Banana is the first non-grass monocotyledon to be sequenced, making it an important genome for the comparative analysis of plants.

This is native to tropical South and Southeast Asia and is grown throughout the tropics, primarily for its familiar fruit. Rich in starch, banana is the most popular fruit in industrialised countries. These plants are sometimes diploid (2 sets of chromosomes) but generally triploid 
(3 sets of chromosomes).
