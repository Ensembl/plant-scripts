Amborella trichopoda is a small, tropical shrub native to the main Island of New Caledonia. It is the only species in the genus Amborella, which is the only member of the family Amborellaceae. As the only living species on the sister lineage to all other flowering plants, it is of great interest for studying plant evolution. Individual Amborella trichopoda are usually sprawling understory shrubs, although they can grow up to eight metres high. They have evergreen leaves and small, white to yellow flowers. The species is dioecious which means the male and female reproductive organs in are in separate individuals. Individual plants can change also sex between flowerings. Unlike nearly all other flowering plants, they do not posses vessel elements for water conduction.

The islands of New Caledonia are a biodiversity hot-spot, preserving many early diverging lineages of plants, of which Amborella is but one. This preservation has been ascribed to climate stability during and since the Tertiary (66 to 3 million years ago), stability that has permitted the continued survival of tropical forests on New Caledonia.
