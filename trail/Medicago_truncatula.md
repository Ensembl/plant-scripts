Medicago truncatula (barrel medic) is a small clover-like annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. Legumes have long been recognized and valued as "soil building" crops. Growing legumes improves soil quality through a process called “nitrogen fixation”, by which nitrogen in the air (useless to all but a few microorganisms) is "fixed" by binding it to other elements, and thus, changing it into a plant available form. For the fixation process to occur, legume plants must enter into a "symbiotic" or mutually beneficial partnership with certain bacteria called rhizobia, which lives in nodules on the plant’s roots.
Maybe the most famous member of the family is “alfalfa”, a widely adapted high yielding forage legume, but with complex genetics. The study of M. truncatula´s genome, which is small and diploid, can give new insights into legume and soil biology, while providing genomic tools and resources for plant breeding and conservation.

rhizobia! 

Medicago truncatula (Barrel Medic) is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. As other legumes, it forms symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. This species has been chosen as a model organism for legume biology because it has a small diploid genome, is self-fertile, has a rapid generation time and prolific seed production, and is amenable to genetic transformation. M. truncatula is a close relative of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a widely cultivated crop with limited genomics tools and complex autotetraploid genetics. As such, the M. truncatula genome sequence provides significant opportunities to expand alfalfa's genomic toolbox. The complete reference sequence displayed here is the 4.0 assembly update published in 2014. The nuclear genome has eight chromosomes.
