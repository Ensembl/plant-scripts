Amborella trichopoda is a small, tropical shrub native to the main Island of New Caledonia. This is the only species in the family Amborellaceae. As the only living species on the sister lineage to all other flowering plants, it is of great interest for studying plant evolution. Individual Amborella trichopoda are usually sprawling understory shrubs, although they can grow up to eight metres high. They have evergreen leaves and small, white to yellow flowers. The species is dioecious which means the male and female reproductive organs are in separate individuals. Individual plants can change also sex between flowerings. Unlike nearly all other flowering plants, they do not posses vessel elements for water conduction. The islands of New Caledonia are a biodiversity hot-spot, preserving many early diverging lineages of plants. This has been ascribed to their climate stability, which permitted the continued survival of tropical forests.
