Selaginella (spikemoss) is an enigma in the plant kingdom. Spikemoss plants are not true mosses but very basic vascular plants that never flower, and have survived virtually unchanged in appearance for hundreds of millions of years.
Sellaginella has a curious ability: under particularly dry conditions, the plant's roots may be uprooted to roll up into brown balls above the ground, entering in an extreme form of dormancy. In this state, the plant can survive for months, even years, patiently waiting for rain. Once there is enough moisture, the roots can return back into the soil and the plant turns green again. For this reason it was called “the resurrection plant”.
Study of its genome is of special importance for understanding the early evolution of vascular land plants. Moreover, scientists are interested in mining its genome in order to find the “resurrection genes”, which can confer plants resistance to unfavourable conditions.

Selaginella moellendorffii is a spikemoss. They belong to the subdivsion of higher vascular plant called lycophytes, an ancient group of plants appeared around 410 million years ago. Selaginella moellendorffii is the first non-seeded plant genome reported, making it a key species for plant evolution studies.

This spikemoss can withstand being completely dried out for years, but is able to resume normal growth and activity by providing it with water. 
It was the first non-seeded plant to have its genome sequenced and is a key species for studying plant evolution.
