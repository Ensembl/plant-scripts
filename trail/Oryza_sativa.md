Oryza sativa
500 Mb, 12 chromosomes, diploid, https://plants.ensembl.org/Oryza_sativa

Oryza sativa (rice), the first crop to have its genome sequenced, is the main source of nutrition for almost 50% of the human population. It is also the model plant used to study other cereals, which together provide about 90% of our calories.
Rice has a particular characteristic: can be cultivated under a wide range of environments, from arid highlands to flooded lowlands, making it a valuable crop in the current context of climate change. 
The study of rice genome is expected to ameliorate problems associated with climate change and food production. In this regard, breeders and researchers are trying to create varieties with traits such as salt tolerance, pest resistance, or higher yield, by classic breeding buy also using genomic based approaches. As an example, the “Golden rice”, a fortified genetically modify variety produced through genetic engineering, is becoming an effective crop for targeting vitamin deficiencies in developing countries.

Oryza sativa Japonica (rice) is the staple food for 2.5 billion people. It is the grain with the second highest worldwide production after corn. In addition to its agronomic importance, rice is an important model species for monocot plants and cereals such as maize, wheat, barley and sorghum. Rice has a compact diploid genome of approximately 500 Mb (n=12) compared with the multi-gigabase genomes of maize, wheat and barley.

There are currently 11 genomes of rice species in Ensembl Plants.
