Selaginella (spikemoss) is an enigma in the plant kingdom. Spikemoss plants are not true mosses but very basic vascular plants that never floweri. They have survived virtually unchanged in appearance for hundreds of millions of years. Spikemoss has a curious ability: under particularly dry conditions, the roots may be uprooted to roll up into brown balls above the ground, entering in an extreme form of dormancy. In this state, the plant can survive for months, even years, patiently waiting for rain. Once there is enough moisture, the roots can return back into the soil and the plant turns green again. For this reason it was called “the resurrection plant”. The study of its genome is of special importance for understanding the early evolution of vascular land plants and for mining the “resurrection genes”, which could confer other plants resistance to unfavourable conditions.
