Oryza sativa Japonica (rice) is the staple food for 2.5 billion people. It is the grain with the second highest worldwide production after corn. In addition to its agronomic importance, rice is an important model species for monocot plants and cereals such as maize, wheat, barley and sorghum. Rice has a compact diploid genome of approximately 500 Mb (n=12) compared with the multi-gigabase genomes of maize, wheat and barley.
