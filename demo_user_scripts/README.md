# Programmatic analysis of plant genomes with Ensembl Plants

This folder contains code examples for interrogating Ensembl Plants from your own scripts.

Note that you can also find some ready to use scripts for phylogenomic studies in folder [phylogenomics](../phylogenomics)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Ensembl/plant_tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Ensembl/plant_tools)

## Dependencies

Some of the scripts depend on additional software packages, see below to learn how to install them.

### FTP

The examples for bulk downloads from the FTP site require the software [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), which is usually installed on most Linux distributions. For macOS it is available on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). For Windows it ships with [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).

### MySQL

The examples for SQL queries to Ensembl Genomes database servers require the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) client.

### Perl

As listed in [cpanfile](./cpanfile), three modules are required: [JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON), [JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS) and [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny)

### Python3



### R
