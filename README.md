# Scripting analyses of genomes in Ensembl Plants

This repo contains code examples for interrogating Ensembl Plants from your own scripts,
and for masking & annotating [repeats](./repeats) in plant genomes.

A few more advanced scripts for phylogenomic studies are documented in repository [plant_tools](https://github.com/Ensembl/plant_tools/tree/master/phylogenomics)

### Dependencies of recipes

Some of the scripts depend on additional software packages, see below to learn how to install them.

#### FTP

The examples for bulk downloads from the FTP site require the software [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), which is usually installed on most Linux distributions. For macOS it is available on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). For Windows it ships with [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).

#### MySQL

The examples for SQL queries to Ensembl Genomes database servers require the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) client. Depending on your Linux flavour this package can be named *mysql-client* or simply *mysql*.

#### Perl

As listed in [cpanfile](./files/cpanfile), three modules are required for the REST examples: [JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON), [JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS) and [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny). You can install them as explained in [phylogenomics](https://github.com/Ensembl/plant_tools/tree/master/phylogenomics).

For the recipes using the Ensembl Perl API please follow the installation [instructions](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html). If you use git please follow [these](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_git.html). There is also a debugging [guide](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/debug_installation_guide.html), which lists some extra dependencies that might not have, such as modules [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI) and [DBD::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql). Note that your local Ensembl API should match the version of the current Ensembl release.

The software VEP has the following Perl dependencies: [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI), [DBD::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql) and [Archive::Zip](https://metacpan.org/pod/Archive::Zip). See full documentation at https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-vep

#### Python

The REST recipes written in python require library [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests).

#### R

For the BioMart recipes you will need BioConductor package [biomaRt](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html), which can be installed with:

    Rscript install_R_deps.R

Full installation instructions can be found [here](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/biomart_r_package.html).

For the REST recipes two core packages are required: [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr) and [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite)
