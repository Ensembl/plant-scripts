Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) is an important crop part that is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, which includes a variety of agricultural crop plants (e.g. potato, pepper, eggplant, and tobacco). The tomato originated in the Andean region of South America, was grown by Aztecs in Mesoamerica, and spread to Europe by early Spanish explorers. Today, hundreds of varieties are grown throughout the world, with the largest producers being China and the United States. In addition to its value as a food, the tomato has served as an important model system for the study of fruit ripening, plant-pathogen interactions, and molecular genetic mapping. The nuclear genome contains 12 chromosomes and the current assembly is ~828 Mb in size.
