Potato is the world's fourth most important food crop after rice, wheat and maize. The potato genome consists of 12 chromosomes, just like tomato and pepper, in four copies (autotetraploid). As tomato, it was domesticated in the Andes and only introduced elsewhere four centuries ago. Outside of its natural range in South America, the cultivated potato is considered to have a narrow genetic base resulting from limited germplasm introductions to Europe, usually in the form of propagated clonal tissues. 

Potato cultivars suffer from acute inbreeding depression,which means they more vulnerable to pests and pathogens as a result of inbreeding, or breeding of very similar potato varieties.

This was one of the main causes of the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century, in which the potato blight destroyed about half the crop in 1845 and virtually all of it in 1846.

Despite the challenges of tetraploid genomes, genomic tools are already routinely used in institutions such as the International Potato Center in Peru to breed new varieties and to understand the genes that make potatos waxy or fluffy.
