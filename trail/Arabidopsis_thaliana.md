Arabidopsis thaliana is a small weed native to Eurasia and Africa. Compared to other relatives of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), such as cabbage or rapeseed, has little agronomic significance. It has been the model organism for plants due to its short generation time, small size, large number of offspring, and small genome. In 2000 it was the first plant ever to have its genome sequenced. Researchers around the world have used this tiny plant as a Rosetta stone for plant biology. Many discoveries about flowering or evolution were made first on Arabidopsis and then transfered to other species and crops. It is the best source of gene annotation for dicot plants. Today many other plants are being used as models for specific topics. For instance, Brachypodium distachyon is regarded as a better model for monocots.
