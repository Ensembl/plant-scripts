Musa acuminata (Banana), is one of the world’s favourite fruits and vital for food security in many tropical and subtropical countries.  
Even though there is some variability in bananas, today, half of the current production relies on clones (“copies”) of a unique genotype called “Cavendish”. That constitutes a latent problem, because pests and diseases have gradually become adapted, representing an imminent danger for global banana production. Years ago, by 1950, an outbreak of the “Panamá disease”, almost wiped out the commercial Gros Michel banana production, the dominant cultivar in that moment, before Cavendish. And that disease is awaking again…
There is an urgent need of banana improvement. However, bananas are difficult to breed: they are triploid (3 sets of chromosomes) and cannot produce viable seeds. The study of banana´s genome is expected to speed up the improvement process, by identifying genes responsible for fruit quality and pest resistance, saving bananas.
