sequencing allows breeding faster; difference between two-row and six-row, 

Barley is the world's fourth most important cereal crop, having been cultivated in all temperate regions from the Arctic Circle to the tropics. With a total of 5300 million DNA letters, this is one of the largest genomes sequenced to date.
It was one of the first cereals domesticated by humans, originating in the Fertile Crescent over 10,000 years ago. 
About two-thirds of the barley in the world is used for animal feed, while the remaining third goes to the malting, brewing, and distilling industries. This includes mostly malt whiskey and also many types of beer.
The UK is a major producer of barley and its malting barley has an international reputation for quality and a ready market in local distillers and brewers.

In recent years the rapid advances in genomics are leading to an unprecedented ability to identify important genes for economically important traits like yield and malting quality, which has a significant impact on breeding programs.

####2-row and 6-row barley
Barley grown for brewers malt is divided into two general types; 2 Row Barley and 6 Row Barley. The most obvious difference between a head of 2-row barley and a head of 6-row barley is the arrangement of the kernels when the head is viewed down its axis. 
In general, 6 Row Malted Barley has more protein and enzyme content than 2 Row Malted Barley, it is thinner than two row malt and contains less carbohydrate. There are also flavor differences between 2-row and 6-row and it seems that most brewers feel 2-row malt produces a fuller, maltier flavor and 6-row malt produces a grainier flavor in the finished beer.
One interesting fact about 6-row barley is that it is only grown in North America, and has has become a symbol of what the European brewers donâ€™t use.
