Marchantia polymorpha (umbrella liverwort) looks like it came from another planet. However, liverworts are among the oldest terrestrial plants, with a wide distribution around the world. M. polymorpha is a non-vascular evergreen plant, with sex chromosomes and separate male and female reproductive structures. It is very versatile. It has the ability to tolerate high lead concentrations in soils, along with other heavy metals. It is also frequently the first vegetation to appear after a large wildfire. After invading the burned area grows rapidly, sometimes covering the entire site and helping in the prevention of soil erosion and renewing the humus. All of these special characteristics that make M. polymorpha unique are “written” somewhere in its genome, being its study a key to understand the evolution and diversification of land plants, and to address questions related to sex chromosome evolution in plants.
