Genomes of plants in the Botanic Garden

The genomes of plants shed light on their history, contain evolutionary treasures and help us understand how plants respond to the environment. They hold the genetic instructions of plants. Since the sequencing in 2000 of the genome of the tiny Arabidopsis thaliana, the number of genomes has steadily increased. Ensembl Plants, a database produced by the European Bioinformatics Institute, holds genomic data of many species that can be found around the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens. Join us on this “Plant genome trail” to meet some of these plants and learn what researchers and breeders hope to find in their genomes.
